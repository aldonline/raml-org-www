**Objective:** Once you’re familiar with the [basics of RAML](http://raml.org/docs.html), it's time to dig into the more complex features of the language itself and take full advantage of what RAML can offer


**Introduction**

This tutorial will guide you through a complete use case for a jukebox API. You’ll learn how to optimize and reuse your code by applying concepts such as resourceTypes and traits, and RAML utilities such as !includes. The tutorial will also demonstrate how RAML uses schemas, and show how to use them to validate an HTTP body.

**Assumptions**

You know the [basics of RAML](http://raml.org/docs.html): how to write a RAML file with resources, parameters, methods, and responses.


**Hands on!**

This tutorial will explain and show snippets of RAML definitions. However, the best learning is to be fully hands-on and play with the code directly. Now, you can easily setup a workspace, mess with the code, and reset it at any step of this tutorial.
