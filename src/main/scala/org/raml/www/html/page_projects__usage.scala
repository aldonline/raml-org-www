              The <a href="http://openag.io/" target="_blank">Open Ag Data Alliance (OADA)</a> is an open project designed to bring interoperability, security, and privacy to agricultural data.<br />
              OADA decided to create an API to enable interoperability between the many precision ag software systems and existing industry data types.<br />
              "By providing an extensible API that focuses on information exchange and facilitates data transformations an open heterogeneous environment that supports many legacy, current, and future data formats can be embraced."<br />
              OADA has chosen RAML for describing their API and "To improve the readability of the specification it rendered into HTML by <a href="https://github.com/kevinrenskers/raml2html">raml2html (developed by kevinrenskers/raml2html)</a> from time to time".<br />

              By centralizing the management of our API products and services and exposing them through a common interface,
              NZ Post has a secure integration platform that enables us to design, publish and manage APIs in a format
              our Customers can easily access and consume.
              We have been able to develop a design-led methodology across the Enterprise, with a high degree of confidence.
              We are now able to engage our Customers in an API design process when innovating/designing new API products
              and when extending the functionality of existing API products.

              The megx.net portal for Marine Ecological GenomiX provides specialized geo-referenced
              databases and web services for the analysis of marine bacteria, archaea,
              and phage genomes and metagenomes.

              <p>
                At megx.net, we started using RAML for API specification.
                It helps us a lot with communicating requirements to our offshore partner.
                I was comparing it to Swagger and WADL and found that RAML strikes
                a better balance between technical aspects and human readability â€¦
                I like the simple API versioning feature of RAML.
                That is important for megx development,  because our dozens of web services evolve differently over time.

                Currently RAML allows us to design and change REST API definitions in a more controlled, but fluid way.
                By adopting RAML, our design first ethos has been significantly improved by having a single source of truth for all of the APIs we publish.
                We have a large investment in C# applications, and the use of an open standard has helped us to design, document, develop and test our API definitions.

            <p>
              CHOCOLABS is one of Taiwan's largest application publishers with over 50 entertainment focused apps under their belt.
              The company is only three years old, but their motto is to "App your Life" across all major platforms (Android and iOS).
            </p>

            <p>The team started using RAML when they realized early on that only an API-first mindset would help them successfully scale their product vision and strategy.
              Their most popular apps are media aggregators, which let end-users quickly search and compile a library of videos of their favorite artists from sources like YouTube for example.
              As a result, CHOCOLABS needed their apps to be built so that they could quickly and accurately retrieve,
              reference and compile 100-1,000s of individual media files across various sources while,
              being stable enough to support consumption by hundreds of thousands of users.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>There are many advantages to taking an api-first development approach.
                API is not a new term - in the past we used web services,
                and had to follow complicated protocols like SOAP to communicate with our backend servers.
                But now, with our custom built APIs, we can tap into any internet resource like text,
                images, videos - you name it-by simply evoking, and pulling their corresponding URL.
                APIs have also evolved, and with the help of tools like RAML, have become more elastic and easier to use.
